### Features
- **Random Background Color Change**: The background color changes randomly from a list of dark colors.
- **Hex Code Display**: The current background color's hex code is displayed on the screen.
- **Interactive Button**: A button triggers the color change, making the page interactive.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling, including layout, colors, and button design.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for changing the background color and updating the hex code displayed.
